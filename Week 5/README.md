# Week 5: JavaScript Foundations with Theme Toggles

## Topics
- Where JavaScript fits alongside HTML and CSS in the browser
- Core syntax: variables, data types, conditionals, and functions
- DOM selection and class toggling for UI state changes
- Designing accessible dark/light themes with CSS custom properties
- Packaging and submitting a standalone HTML project

## Learning Objectives
- Explain the browser rendering pipeline and how JavaScript collaborates with markup and styles.
- Declare variables with `let`/`const`, evaluate conditions, and run functions in response to user actions.
- Manipulate the DOM with `querySelector`, `classList`, and text updates to drive visual changes.
- Use CSS variables to coordinate color palettes for dark and light modes while preserving contrast.
- Bundle an HTML file (with embedded CSS/JS) and verify it renders consistently across devices.

## Activities
- Mini-lecture covering JavaScript syntax fundamentals and DOM manipulation patterns.
- Live demo adding a dark/light toggle to a static page using class switches and CSS variables.
- Guided lab where students build a simple landing page that supports Dark Mode and Live Preview Mode (accent shift) toggles.
- Peer checks focusing on accessibility, color contrast, and error-free console output.

## Materials
- Week 5 slide deck (`Week5_JS_Basics.pptx`) with annotated speaker notes.
- Instructor guide (`Teacher_Guide.md`) containing the demo walkthrough, solution code, and grading checklist.
- Student lab handout (`Week5_JS_Theme_Toggle_Lab.md`) outlining the deliverable and rubric.
- Demo starter HTML (`Week5_JS_Demo_Starter.html`) for the live coding segment.
- Optional: contrast checker link (e.g., WebAIM) for accessibility verification.

## Lab Overview
- **Part 1: Scaffold & Style** – Start from the provided base markup, define CSS variables for two themes, and organize content with semantic HTML.
- **Part 2: Implement Toggles** – Wire two buttons: one for Dark/Light, one for Live Mode accent shift; update classes and button labels via JavaScript.
- **Part 3: Validate & Document** – Test keyboard navigation, ensure console is clean, and record a brief reflection within the HTML file.

## Preparation & Follow-up
- Practice the live demo to rehearse the toggle logic and error handling language.
- Confirm students can open the starter HTML locally (VS Code + Live Server or double-click in a browser).
- Remind the class to keep CSS variables at the top of the file for clarity and easy adjustments.
- After the session, curate strong submissions and share annotated screenshots; encourage recreating the project in CodePen for optional sharing.
