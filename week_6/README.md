## Week 6 — Python First Programs: Variables, I/O, Decisions, Loops

Anchored to: Fundamentals of Python: First Programs (MindTap), 3rd Edition

Audience: Students with little/no prior coding experience. Tone: welcoming, practical, growth mindset.

Lesson length: 2 hours lecture + 2 hours lab

Learning objectives
- Describe what a program is and how Python executes it (interpretation, statements).
- Write and run simple Python scripts in Jupyter/Colab with input/output.
- Use variables, numeric types, and expressions to compute values.
- Make decisions with if/elif/else and compare values.
- Use while/for loops to repeat work; iterate over strings and ranges.
- Apply the above to small, useful tasks and a tiny data task.

Why this matters (motivation)
- Programming turns ideas into tools: calculators, text processors, and data insights.
- Today’s lab shows immediate value: tip/salary calculators, password strength checks, and a mini data exploration.

Connections to the textbook (by theme)
- Getting Started with Python: running code, print(), comments
- Variables and Input: input(), assignment, types (int, float, str), type conversion
- Decisions: if/elif/else, comparison and logical operators
- Repetition: for/while, range(), basic accumulation patterns

Materials
- Jupyter/Colab, this README, `Lab_Student.ipynb`, projector/whiteboard

Agenda (suggested timing)
1) Warm-up & context (10m)
   - What problems can code solve for you? Show 2–3 quick demos (e.g., unit converter, personal finance).
2) Python basics live-coding (35m)
   - print(), comments, variables, input(), int()/float() casting
   - Expressions: +, -, *, /, //, %, **, parentheses
   - f-strings for formatted output
3) Decisions (20m)
   - if/elif/else, comparison (==, !=, <, <=, >, >=), logical (and/or/not)
   - Example: classify temperature; simple password-strength hints
4) Loops (25m)
   - for with range(), while loops, off-by-one awareness
   - Patterns: running total, counting/flagging, min/max
5) Break (5m)
6) Guided lab start (15m)
   - Walk through the first exercises in `Lab_Student.ipynb`
7) Lab work (60m)
   - Students complete notebook tasks (helpers circulate)
8) Share-out & wrap (10m)
   - Volunteers demo solutions; highlight takeaways and next steps

Assessment & artifacts
- Completion of `Lab_Student.ipynb` tasks
- 1-minute reflection: “What small tool would you build next?”

Differentiation & supports
- Pair programming for newcomers; stretch prompts for faster learners
- Provide starter code snippets and type hints in the notebook
- Emphasize that errors are normal; read error messages together

Homework (optional)
- Extend one lab task into a slightly bigger script (e.g., multi-item budget calculator)
- Reading: corresponding textbook sections on variables, decisions, loops

Preview of next week
- Functions and modularity: packaging logic for reuse; simple data structures

Mini data science teaser (5–10m)
- Show reading a tiny CSV using Python’s `csv` module and computing a mean
- Reinforce that Python scales from tiny scripts to real data analysis
