Title: CST1100 Weeks 1–7 Midterm Review
Audience: Intro to Computing students
Duration: 90 minutes
Instructor: ____________________
Date: ____________________

## Learning Goals
- Explain why digital systems rely on binary representation and ASCII encoding.
- Refresh Python fundamentals: conversion utilities, control flow, loops, and file iteration.
- Reinforce logic gate behavior and CPU instruction cycle terminology.
- Review foundational SQL syntax for querying and text concatenation.
- Build confidence answering multiple-choice questions by unpacking rationales.

## Materials
- Quiz question set (projected or printed)
- Slide deck (`quiz_review_slides.pptx`)
- Whiteboard/doc cam for live conversions and code tracing
- Python interpreter and SQL sandbox (optional demos)
- Sticky notes or poll tool for quick checks

## Session Agenda

| Time | Segment | Objectives & Facilitation Moves |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0:00–0:10 | Welcome & Warm-Up Diagnostic | Use 3 quick binary/logic questions to surface misconceptions. Invite students to flag topics they fear most. |
| 0:10–0:25 | Data Representation Spotlight | Present Q1–Q7 themes. Model binary↔decimal conversion, bits vs bytes, ASCII lookup, and color depth. |
| 0:25–0:40 | Guided Practice: Binary & ASCII | Pair activity on Q1–Q6. Debrief emphasizing reasoning, not just answers. |
| 0:40–0:55 | Logic & CPU Cycle | Build NOT/AND truth tables (Q8–Q9). Walk through Fetch → Decode → Execute (Q10). Demo Python floor division for Q11. |
| 0:55–1:10 | Python Essentials Circuit | Triads tackle Q12–Q18. Encourage live testing of strings, comments, boolean expressions, and ranges. Share sample code. |
| 1:10–1:20 | SQL Refresher | Revisit SELECT usage (Q19) and PostgreSQL concatenation (Q20). Compare with SQL Server syntax to highlight differences. |
| 1:20–1:30 | Synthesis & Exit Ticket | Summarize cross-cutting ideas. Collect 3-question exit ticket mirroring tricky items and a “muddiest point” note. |

## Differentiation Strategies
- Pair students strategically: mix confident and developing learners during practice.
- Provide ASCII charts and binary conversion scaffolds for students needing visual aids.
- Offer challenge prompts (e.g., convert decimal 27 to binary) for advanced learners.
- Encourage “think aloud” debugging when testing Python snippets.

## Formative Assessment
- Warm-up polling results to guide reteaching focus.
- Cold-calls during debrief to check conceptual understanding.
- Exit tickets to identify persistent misconceptions before the midterm.

## Homework / Extension
- Students author two original multiple-choice questions (with explanations) matching quiz scope.
- Optional: revisit textbook or linked resources on binary, Python loops, and SQL basics.

## Instructor Reflection Notes
- Record questions that triggered confusion to tailor future review.
- Note timing adjustments for segments that ran long or short.
- Plan targeted office hours or asynchronous support for weak spots identified.
