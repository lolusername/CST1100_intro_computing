    "# Week 6 Lab ‚Äî Python First Programs: Variables, I/O, Decisions, Loops\n",
    "**Duration: ~90 minutes** | **Reference: Fundamentals of Python: First Programs, 3rd Ed.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Welcome to Your First Programming Lab! üêç\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab assumes **no prior coding experience**. We'll build real, useful programs step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What You'll Learn Today\n",
    "- **Variables & Data Types**: Store and work with different kinds of information\n",
    "- **Input/Output**: Get data from users and display results beautifully  \n",
    "- **Decision Making**: Write programs that make choices (`if/elif/else`)\n",
    "- **Repetition**: Automate repetitive tasks with loops (`for` and `while`)\n",
    "- **Data Analysis**: Process real data (like fitness tracking) with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lab Structure (90 minutes)\n",
    "1. **Getting Started** (15 min) - Hello World & Variables\n",
    "2. **User Interaction** (15 min) - Input, Output, Type Conversion  \n",
    "3. **Decision Making** (20 min) - Smart Calculators & Logic\n",
    "4. **Repetition & Loops** (20 min) - Automating Tasks\n",
    "5. **Data Analysis** (15 min) - Working with Real Data\n",
    "6. **Reflection & Next Steps** (5 min)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pro Tips for Success\n",
    "- **Run cells one at a time** (Shift+Enter)\n",
    "- **Read error messages** ‚Äî they're clues, not failures!\n",
    "- **Experiment freely** ‚Äî change numbers and strings to see what happens\n",
    "- **Ask questions** ‚Äî programming is collaborative!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Book References\n",
    "- **Chapter 1**: Getting Started with Python\n",
    "- **Chapter 2**: Variables and Input  \n",
    "- **Chapter 3**: Decision Structures\n",
    "- **Chapter 4**: Repetition Structures\n"
