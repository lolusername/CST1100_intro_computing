# Week 4: Hardware Logic & SQL Foundations

## Topics
- Digital abstraction, voltage levels, and logic gates
- Truth tables and combinational circuit design
- Building half- and full-adders in Python simulations
- Origins of SQL and relational databases
- Core SQL syntax: `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT`, and `SELECT`

## Learning Objectives
- Interpret and construct truth tables for elementary logic gates
- Combine gates to design adders and reason about circuit correctness
- Simulate gate behavior programmatically in Python
- Summarize the history and purpose of SQL in managing relational data
- Execute foundational SQL statements to create and query datasets

## Activities
- Mini-lecture and slide discussion on hardware logic and SQL origins
- Guided Python lab exploring gates and adder circuits
- SQL sandbox activity using SQLite to practice basic queries
- Group reflection on how hardware and data layers connect

## Materials
- Week 4 slide deck (`Week4_Hardware_Logic_SQL.pptx`)
- Student lab notebook (`Week4_Lab_Student.ipynb`)
- Teacher lab notebook with solutions (`Week4_Lab_Teacher.ipynb`)
- Optional printable truth table handouts

## Lab Overview
- **Part 1: Logic Simulation** – Implement AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR in Python and assemble a half- and full-adder.
- **Part 2: SQL Foundations** – Use in-notebook SQLite to build a simple table, insert sample data, and compose `SELECT` queries with filtering and sorting.

## Preparation & Follow-up
- Review Chapters 4 and 6 in *Computer Science Illuminated* for context
- Skim a brief history of SQL (IBM System R, ANSI standardization)
- After class, deploy the adder notebook to Google Colab and extend with logging truth tables to CSV for Supabase import.
